resume_header_intro: "<p> Self-taught Python programmer with Linux experience. Whilst at college in my spare time I taught myself Python and the Linux CLI. My current job has given me great skills in working with the public and alongside a team. I have been trusted with many integral parts of the business, for example: lock keeping, cashing up, price changing, and stock ordering. I am an approachable, understanding and respectful person that works well with a team. I am also a quick learner that is willing to stop at nothing to learn something new. An example of my quick learning would be that straight after completing the basic Python course on codeacademy I went to develop a bot that would parse IRC messages using Regex (Regular Expressions) and use the information to access certain files on the web.</p>"
